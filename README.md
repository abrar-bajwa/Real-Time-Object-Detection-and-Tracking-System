# Real-Time-Object-Detection-and-Tracking-System
This algorithm is a real-time object detection and tracking system that utilizes deep learning techniques and OpenCV library to detect and track objects in real-time video streams. It uses a pre-trained object detection model (such as YOLO or Faster R-CNN) to detect objects in each frame of the video stream and applies non-maximum suppression to remove duplicate detections. A tracking algorithm (such as Kalman filter or correlation filter) is used to track the detected objects across multiple frames. The algorithm also provides a real-time visual output of the object detection and tracking system.
# Potential Applications
The potential applications of this algorithm are numerous, including security and surveillance, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and any other application that requires real-time object detection and tracking. In the field of security and surveillance, your algorithm can be used to monitor crowds, track vehicles, and identify suspicious behavior. In the field of autonomous vehicles, This algorithm can be used to detect and track other vehicles and objects on the road, enabling safer and more efficient navigation. In the field of robotics,This algorithm can be used to enable robots to navigate and interact with their environment. Overall, this algorithm has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications where real-time object detection and tracking is required.

# How this Algorithm Works
This algorithm uses the OpenCV library to load a pre-trained object detection model, read a video stream, and detect and track objects in real-time. The algorithm applies non-maximum suppression to remove duplicate detections, and uses a Kalman filter-based tracker to track the detected objects across multiple frames. The algorithm also provides a real-time visual output of the object detection and tracking system. Note that the algorithm assumes you have already obtained the pre-trained model and have specified the appropriate paths to the model configuration and weights files, as well as the confidence and non-maximum suppression thresholds.


# Steps:
1.	Load a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN) and a video stream.
2.	Use the object detection model to detect objects in each frame of the video stream.
3.	Apply non-maximum suppression to remove duplicate detections.
4.	Use a tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter, correlation filter) to track the detected objects across multiple frames.
5.	Update the tracking algorithm with new object detections and remove old tracks when objects leave the field of view.
6.	Optionally, integrate the system with other sensors (e.g., lidar, radar) to improve object detection and tracking performance.
7.	Provide a real-time visual output of the object detection and tracking system.

# Important Instructions
Make sure to define the path to your model configuration file and weights file in the code, like so:
```cmd
model_config_path = '/path/to/model/config/file.cfg'
model_weights_path = '/path/to/model/weights/file.weights'
``` 
Then use these variables as input parameters when calling the cv2.dnn.readNetFromDarknet() function:
# Make file
```cmd
model = cv2.dnn.readNetFromDarknet(model_config_path, model_weights_path)
```
Without specifying the correct file paths, the code will not be able to read in the pre-trained object detection model and you will receive the NameError.
